                I am a highly motivated developer with a passion to design and
                combine features to create the best experience for users. I
                consider myself to be a student who is eager to learn and build
                on my technical skill while stay tuned with the latest updates
                on software developments.

                Aside from designing, I also have strong passion in music. As a
                bassist, I enjoy creating music that motivates listeners with
                groove and low end rhythm. In my spare time, I create bass
                covers of various styles of music and am currently part of a
                band called "Lost n' Found".
